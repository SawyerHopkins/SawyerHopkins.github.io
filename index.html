          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Kansas State University</h2>
          <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;"> I have begun classwork at K-State and I am currently being funded through a graduate teaching assistantship and the Timothy R. Donoghue Graduate Scholarship. I have also begun working in the soft matter research group with Dr. Chris Sorensen. This research is currently focused on examining the mechanisms behind our new patent-pending process for directly creating nanoparticles via direct dissolution.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Michigan Technological University</h2>
          <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">I worked for three years as a nanotechnologies researcher with Dr. Yoke Khin Yap at Michigan Technological University. My research there was focused on the synthesis of boron nitride nanosheets through chemical vapour deposition and examining their material properties. In doing so I discovered that boron nitride nanosheets have the ability to enhance thermal dissipation in silicon. I left Michigan Tech leading way into initial research on creating commercial applications of boron nitride nanosheets for heat dissipation purposes.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">SciLib</h2>
          <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">SciLib is a numerical analysis and computation engine created using C#, F#, and XNA/MonoGame. This project started as an experiment to explore the logic needed to perform generic N-Space calculations while also learning the oddities of Microsoft's new scientific programming language F#. Later I found having this N-Space computational engine to be very useful for various aspects of my research and course work. Today SciLib is a compilation of various scientific and mathematical tools I have built using this computational engine, and includes basic mathematics, integration, and 3D plotting amongst various other tools. The source code is currently available on my GitHub which is accessible via the social links at the top of the page.</p>
