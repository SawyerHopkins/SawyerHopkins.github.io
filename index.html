				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</header>
							
			<p>
			I am a graduate of Michigan Technological University with a bachelors degree in physics. I am currently attending Kansas State University to pursue my Ph.D. with research interests in applied nanotechnologies, solid state physics, and computational sciences. I am a computer and programming enthusiast, primarily working C#. I am familiar with several other languages including F#, Java, Python, C++, and MATLAB.

				<h3>Dr. Yoke Khin Yap Research Group</h3>
			</header>	
							
			<p>I have been a nanotechnologies researcher with Dr. Yoke Khin Yap for two years. Over the course of this time I have become very familiar with the chemical vapor deposition process for synthesizing various nanostructures, and have spent most of my efforts in examining the thermal properties of boron nitride nanosheets. My research is currently focused on finding potential methods in which these nanostructures can be used to solve industrial problems of thermal dissipation and heat management. </p>

				<h3>MTU Teaching Assistant</h3>
			</header>	
							
			<p>This is my third year working a teaching assistant in physics department at Michigan Technological University. Over the course of this time I have been a TA for the university wide introductory survey of physics lab (PH1100), and am currently the TA for the electronics laboratory which is part of the physics undergraduate curriculum (PH2230).</p>

				SciLib is a numerical analysis and computation engine created using C#, F#, and XNA. This project started as an experiment to explore the logic needed to perform generic N-Space calculations while also learning the oddities of Microsoft's new scientific programming language F#. Later I found that having this N-Space computational engine could be very useful for various elements of my research and course work. Today SciLib is a compilation of various scientific and mathematical tools I have built using this computational engine and includes basic mathematics, integration, RK4 analysis, and 3D plotting amongst various other tools. The source code is currently available on my GitHub which is accessible via the social links on the left.
