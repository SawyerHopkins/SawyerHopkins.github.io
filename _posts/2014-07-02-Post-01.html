<p class="post-header">Migration Summary</p>
	
<p> I have migrated my website from some rather old HTML5 template to a new sleek website built upon the Twitter Bootstrap Carousel example. This update should provide a much better presence across all platforms and also help facilitate my new programming and technology blog. I am using Jekyll for the blog as it is the content management system already being used on GitHub Pages. Since most of my work as of late has been with Visual Studio, I opted to install Jekyll on Windows. There are plenty of guides already floating about cyberspace detailing the installation and setup process for every operating system so I won't be writing a step by step tutorial. Instead I will just note a few "optional" steps not specifically mentioned most guides. </p>

<p class="post-header">A Few Notes</p>

<p> When setting up buttons for sharing blog posts on social networks, my first instinct was to get the code for the standard Like, +1, and Retweet buttons and throw them at the end of each post. After implementing these however, their performance was rather slow and I also was not a fan of the extra JavaScript needed to facilitate these seemingly simple buttons. So after a bit more digging I was able to find that most social networks have sharing URLS, which I was able to easily implement with the following code.</p>

{% highlight css linenos %}

<!-- Twitter -->
<div class="share-button twitter">
	<a href="https://twitter.com/home?status={% raw %}{{ page.url }}{% endraw %}"><i class="fa fa-twitter social"></i></a>
</div>
<!-- LinkedIn -->
<div class="share-button linkedin">
	<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url={% raw %}{{ page.url }}{% endraw %}&title={% raw %}{{ page.title }}{% endraw %}&summary={% raw %}{{ page.summary }}{% endraw %}&source=SawyerHopkins"><i class="fa fa-linkedin social"></i></a>
</div>
<!-- Google Plus -->
<div class="share-button gplus">
	<a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url={% raw %}{{ page.url }}{% endraw %}"><i class="fa fa-google-plus social"></i></a>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

<p> As you can see this lent itself quite nicely to Jekyll implementation, using the Liquid syntax to place the post URL into the appropriate place for each social network. This example leads way into the next problem I had setting up Jekyll. The code above is highlighted using Pygments, a python based syntax highlighter. This script puts CSS class tags around keywords depending on the selected language, and as such an appropriate CSS template is needed to actually create the highlighting. The Jekyll webpage suggests a GitHub repo with a syntax.css file, however this file was not complete for the new Pygments 6.0+. Luckily Pygments has a command line function to output a standard CSS file for the current version.</p>

{% highlight console %}

$ pygmentize -S default -f html > style.css

{% endhighlight %}

<p> This helpful function will spit out a pre-populated style.css file in your current directory which is just about ready for use. The only thing missing was some formatting on the line numbering, which was easily fixed by adding the <i>lineno</i> class to the syntax.css file.</p>

{% highlight css %}
.lineno { padding-right: 5px; border-right: 1px solid #ccc; }
{% endhighlight %}

<p> And that is pretty much all the oddities I have experienced setting up a Jekyll based website. One last thing I found useful when going through the redesign, though not really Jekyll specific, was <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Kuler</a> which creates different colour palettes based off of an input colour.
